      "*   `year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0`: This handles the common case where a year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4 but not by 100 (e.g., 2024, 2008).\n",
      "*   `year % 400 == 0`: This handles the exception to the \"divisible by 100\" rule. If a year *is* divisible by 100, it's *only* a leap year if it's also divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000, 1600). Years like 1900 fall into the \"divisible by 100 but not by 400\" category, making them *not* leap years.\n",

      "    *   Covers years divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000).\n",
      "    *   Uses `self.assertTrue()` to assert that the function returns `True`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`test_non_leap_years`**:\n",
      "    *   Covers years not divisible by 4 (e.g., 2023).\n",
      "    *   Covers years divisible by 100 but not by 400 (e.g., 1900).\n",
      "    *   Uses `self.assertFalse()` to assert that the function returns `False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`test_invalid_input_type`**:\n",
      "    *   Uses `self.assertRaises(TypeError, ...)` to ensure that the function correctly raises a `TypeError` when provided with non-integer inputs (strings, floats, `None`).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`test_invalid_year_value`**:\n",
      "    *   Uses `self.assertRaises(ValueError, ...)` to check for negative year inputs, which are typically not considered valid for calendar years.\n",
      "    *   Explicitly tests year `0` as an edge case. Mathematically, `0` satisfies the `divisible by 400` rule, so the function returns `True`. If your requirements state that year `0` is invalid, you'd add a `ValueError` check for `year == 0` in the function.\n"
